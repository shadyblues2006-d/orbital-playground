# Orbital Playground

Orbital Playground is a space mission feasibility playground.  
It allows you to experiment with:

- Hohmann transfer Δv calculations between orbits
- Mission feasibility checks using the rocket equation
- A library of real and hypothetical destinations
- Explanations of why missions are feasible or infeasible
- Visual Δv budget charts for comparison

## Features
- Δv calculator for orbit transfers
- Rocket equation simulator
- Mission context with educational notes
- Menu-driven CLI for ease of use
- Visualization of Δv budgets

## Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
